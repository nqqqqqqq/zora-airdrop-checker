    # ðŸª‚ Zora Airdrop Checker

    A script for checking the amount of tokens received by wallets in the Zora airdrop. Supports multithreading for fast processing of large wallet lists.

    ## ðŸ“¦ Features

    - Reads wallet addresses from `wallets.txt`
    - Sends GraphQL queries to [Zora API](https://api.zora.co/universal/graphql)
    - Retries on errors or server overload
    - Saves wallets with non-zero token balances to `good.txt`
    - Multithreaded wallet processing

    ## ðŸš€ Quick Start

    1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/zora-airdrop-checker.git
    cd zora-airdrop-checker
    ```

    2. Install dependencies (activate a virtual environment if you're using one):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    3. Add wallet addresses to `wallets.txt` â€” one per line:
    ```
    0x184a89de9337abea8f2c4baab3cd675695dd2c5c
    0xb03f2a031dd1e2291fdbfc0cbc1dd65dd457023c
    ...
    ```

    4. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    5. Results will be saved to `good.txt` in the format:
    ```
    0xabc123...:115.48672
    ```

    ## ðŸ›  Configuration

    - You can change the number of threads by modifying `max_workers` in `main.py`:
    ```python
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
    ```
